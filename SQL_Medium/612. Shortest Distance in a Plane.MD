# 612. Shortest Distance in a Plane

## Description

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-in-a-plane/)


## Solution
### Solution 1
```SQL
SELECT ROUND(SQRT(MIN(P1.X-P2.X)*(P1.X-P2.X)+(P1.Y-P2.Y)*(P1.Y-P2.Y)),2) AS shortest
FROM Point2D P1, Point2D P2
WHERE P1.X <> P2.X OR P1.Y<>P2.Y;
```
### Solution 1
```
WHERE P1.X <> P2.X OR P1.Y<>P2.Y;
```
equals

```
where (P1.x,P1.y)!=(P2.x,P2.y)
```

## Notes

SELECT the combination of all the distance and return the MIN, where SAME ROWs don't calculate themselves
