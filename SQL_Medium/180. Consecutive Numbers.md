# 180. Consecutive Numbers

## Description

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/consecutive-numbers/)


## Solution
### Solution 1 

```SQL
WITH cte AS
(SELECT id, num, 
 LAG(num) over(order by id ASC) as num_before, 
 LEAD(num) over(order by id ASC) as num_after
 FROM logs)

SELECT DISTINCT num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM cte
WHERE num=num_before and num_after =num_before;
```
* ```with xx as``` set up a new table, covenient for query next


### Solution 2 
```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT
    l1.Num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM
    Logs l1,
    Logs l2,
    Logs l3
WHERE
    l1.Id = l2.Id - 1
    AND l2.Id = l3.Id - 1
    AND l1.Num = l2.Num
    AND l2.Num = l3.Num
;
```
* Core : using multiple joins



## Notes
* ```lag()/lead() OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY...)```
  *   ```order by``` is necessary, specifying the column of values you are ranking
  *   ```partition by``` is optional, equals to ```group by```, rank in the same group, re-rank in other groups
  *  ```Lag(JoiningDate, 2,'1999-09-01')```
      *  default offset 1 in Lag function, and it takes value from the previous row. 
      *  defalu value will be null unless specify as ```'1999-09-01'```
      *  offset value 2 : In the output, you can see we have a default value for row 1 and 2. In row 3, it takes value from row 1:
