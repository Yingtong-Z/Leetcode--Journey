# 178. Rank Scores

## Description

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/rank-scores/)


## Solution
### Solution 1 (preferred)

```SQL
SELECT score, DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY score DESC) AS 'rank'
FROM Scores;
#ORDER BY score DESC;
```
* ```ORDER BY score DESC;``` is optional here
*  rank is keyword here, so must be 'rank'

### Solution 2 
```SQL
SELECT score, (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT score) FROM Scores WHERE score>=S.score) 'Rank'
FROM Scores S
ORDER BY score DESC
```
* Core : For each score in the Scores table, we want to see **how many scores in the subquery table > (or =) that score**
* reference link : [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/rank-scores/discuss/456610/MySQL-Two-Simple-Solutions-and-Explanations-for-Beginners)
* Requires complicate logic 


## Notes
* ```Rank()/DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY...)```
  *   ```order by``` is necessary, specifying the column of values you are ranking
  *   ```partition by``` is optional, equals to ```group by```, rank in the same group, re-rank in other groups
  *   Identical values : ```RANK()``` will give them same ranks,and skip the next ranking ;  ```DENSE_RANK() ``` will use the next chronological ranking value
