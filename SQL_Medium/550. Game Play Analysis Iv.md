## Description

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/game-play-analysis-iv/)


## Solution
### Solution 1 

```SQL
with cte as(SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS first_date
            FROM Activity
            GROUP BY player_id),
     cte2 as (SELECT C.player_id
              FROM cte C
              JOIN Activity A
              ON C.player_id = A.player_id AND first_date = event_date -1)

SELECT ROUND((SELECT COUNT(player_id)
              FROM cte2) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(player_id))
                           FROM Activity),2) AS fraction
```
* join ```on date = date -1``` works
* with clause work slow


### Solution 2 
```SQL
SELECT ROUND(COUNT(t2.player_id)/COUNT(t1.player_id),2) AS fraction
FROM
(SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS first_login 
 FROM Activity 
 GROUP BY player_id) t1 
LEFT JOIN Activity t2
ON t1.player_id = t2.player_id AND t1.first_login = t2.event_date - 1
```
* Core :```t2.player_id``` will only be the matching number from  ```LEFT JOIN Activity t2``` 



## Notes
* join ```on date = date -1``` works
