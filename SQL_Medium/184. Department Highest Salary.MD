## Solution
### Solution 1 (preferred)

```SQL
WITH SLRANK AS(SELECT name, 
                      salary,
                      departmentId, 
                      RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY departmentId 
                                  ORDER BY salary DESC) AS 'rank'
              FROM Employee)

SELECT D.name as Department, S.name AS Employee, S.salary
FROM SLRANK S
LEFT JOIN Department D
ON S.departmentId = D.id
WHERE S.rank = 1
```
*  rank is keyword here, so must be 'rank'
* ```MAX(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY departmentId)``` will not select only the max value, instead it will output all the value and max value as the other column


## Notes
* ```Rank()/DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY...)```
  *   ```order by``` is necessary, specifying the column of values you are ranking
  *   ```partition by``` is optional, equals to ```group by```, rank in the same group, re-rank in other groups
  *   Identical values : ```RANK()``` will give them same ranks,and skip the next ranking ;  ```DENSE_RANK() ``` will use the next chronological ranking value
