## Description

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/second-highest-salary/)


## Solution
### Solution 1
```SQL
SELECT IFNULL((SELECT DISTINCT salary
              FROM Employee
              ORDER BY salary DESC
              LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1), null) AS SecondHighestSalary
```
* Do not need ```FROM Employee``` at the end, since already finish selection

### Solution 2

```sql
SELECT IFNULL(MAX(salary), null) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee 
WHERE salary NOT IN (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee);
```
* first max(salary) better than DISTINCT salary then order by and limit 1


## Notes
* ```OFFSET``` follows ```LIMIT``` means **from where to start returning data**, offset 1 means start from 2nd row
*  ```SELECT``` do not necessary need to followed by ```FROM```, when subquery is nested in ```SELECT``` 
*  USE ```MAX``` to get the largest
