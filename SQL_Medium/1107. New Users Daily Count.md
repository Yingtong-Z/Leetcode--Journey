```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT activity_date AS login_date, COUNT(1) user_count
FROM (
SELECT user_id, min(activity_date) as activity_date
FROM Traffic
WHERE activity = 'login'
GROUP BY user_id
) A
#WHERE activity_date > '2019-03-30' 
where login_date between date_add('2019-06-30', interval -90 day) and '2019-06-30'
GROUP BY activity_date
```

## Notes

- ```where login_date between date_add('2019-06-30', interval -90 day) and '2019-06-30'``` -- within at most 90 days from today
- ```SELECT user_id, min(activity_date) as activity_date``` filter the first log-in day
