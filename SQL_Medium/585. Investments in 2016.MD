[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/investments-in-2016/)


## Solution
### Solution 1
```SQL
SELECT ROUND(SUM(tiv_2016),2) AS tiv_2016
FROM Insurance 
WHERE tiv_2015 IN (SELECT tiv_2015 FROM Insurance GROUP BY tiv_2015 HAVING COUNT(1)>1 )
AND (lat,lon) IN (SELECT lat, lon FROM Insurance GROUP BY lat, lon HAVING COUNT(1)=1);
```
* wrong:
```SQL
SELECT ROUND(SUM(tiv_2016),2) AS tiv_2016
FROM Insurance 
GROUP BY tiv_2015....
```
* ```sum tiv_2016``` only in group by 
* ```(SELECT lat, lon FROM Insurance GROUP BY lat, lon HAVING COUNT(1)=1)``` will output unique pairs of lat, lon

### Solution 2

```sql
select round(sum(TIV_2016),2) as TIV_2016
from insurance i
where (select count(*) from insurance i1 where i.TIV_2015 = i1.TIV_2015)>1 and 
      (select count(*) from insurance i2 where (i.LAT, i.LON) = (i2.LAT, i2.LON))=1;
```
* For the first  ....... > 1means it only selects the frequency of tiv2015 greater than 1, which means they have the same tiv2015 value
* For the second where  ....... =1 means latitude and longitude should be unique and not contain any duplicated value
