[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/reformat-department-table/)


## Solution

```SQL
SELECT id,
       SUM(IF(month = 'Jan', revenue, null)) AS Jan_Revenue,
       SUM(IF(month = 'Feb', revenue, null)) AS Feb_Revenue,
       SUM(IF(month = 'Mar', revenue, null)) AS Mar_Revenue,
       SUM(IF(month = 'Apr', revenue, null)) AS Apr_Revenue,
       SUM(IF(month = 'May', revenue, null)) AS May_Revenue,
       SUM(IF(month = 'Jun', revenue, null)) AS Jun_Revenue,
       SUM(IF(month = 'Jul', revenue, null)) AS Jul_Revenue,
       SUM(IF(month = 'Aug', revenue, null)) AS Aug_Revenue,
       SUM(IF(month = 'Sep', revenue, null)) AS Sep_Revenue,
       SUM(IF(month = 'Oct', revenue, null)) AS Oct_Revenue,
       SUM(IF(month = 'Nov', revenue, null)) AS Nov_Revenue,
       SUM(IF(month = 'Dec', revenue, null)) AS Dec_Revenue
FROM Department
GROUP BY id
ORDER BY id;
```


## Notes
* **why use sum:** 
  *  before group by, it will return multiple rows for each id + month pair, (e.g. for id=1 we have Jan_Revenues: NULL, 8000 and NULL)
  *  when group by, we need to select only 8000 value, this is why we need either SUM (NULL+8000+NULL), output is 8000

* **If there are no rows, sum() will return null . It will also return null if all rows have a null balance**
