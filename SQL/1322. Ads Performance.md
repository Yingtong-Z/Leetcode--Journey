 # 1322. Ads Performance

## Description

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/ads-performance/)


## Solution

```SQL
SELECT ad_id, IFNULL(ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN action = 'Clicked' THEN 1
                               WHEN action = 'Viewed' THEN 0
                               ELSE NULL END)*100,2),0.00) AS ctr
FROM Ads
GROUP BY ad_id
ORDER BY ctr DESC, ad_id;
```
* explanation
  - ctr = clicked/(clicked+viewed)

  - here we assigned action as 1 when clicked, 0 when viewed, NULL when neither.
  - You need to notice that **NULL doesn't count** when calculate avg.

  - So: AVG(******) = (clicked_count *1 + viewed_count *0) / (clicked_count + viewed_count)
      = clicked_count / (clicked_count + viewed_count)
      = ctr

## Notes
* AVG(), SUM() can take care of boolean since they ignore the null value 
* ``` SELECT SUM(IF(my_bool=1, 1, 0)) AS YES, SUM(IF(my_bool=0, 1, 0)) AS NO ```
  *   only sum the 1 'true' value in the boolean
  *   SUM(IF(my_bool=1, 1, 0)) = SUM(my_bool=1)
* ``` avg(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) ```
  * true/true+false
  * **avg( case when ..)CAN assign more than two conditions and NULL to calculate the true/true+false without NULL**
