# 1327. List the Products Ordered in a Period

## Description

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/list-the-products-ordered-in-a-period/)


## Solution

**My Solution**

```SQL
SELECT p.product_name, o.unit_sum AS unit
FROM Products p 
LEFT JOIN (SELECT product_id, SUM(unit) AS unit_sum
           FROM Orders
           WHERE order_date LIKE '2020-02%'
           GROUP BY product_id) o
ON p.product_id = o.product_id
WHERE o.unit_sum >= 100;
```
```WHERE order_date LIKE '2020-02%'``` is better than ```WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2020-02-01' AND '2020-02-29'```

**Better Solution**

```SQL
SELECT p.product_name, SUM(o.unit) AS unit
FROM Products p 
LEFT JOIN Orders o
ON p.product_id = o.product_id
WHERE order_date LIKE '2020-02%'
GROUP BY p.product_id
HAVING SUM(o.unit)>=100;
```

```HAVING SUM(o.unit)>=100;``` is better than using subquery
## Notes
Before using subquery, think about all the commands that could be used without subquery
