# 1142. User Activity for the Past 30 Days II

## Description

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/user-activity-for-the-past-30-days-ii/)


## Solution

**Correct**

```SQL
SELECT IFNULL(ROUND(SUM(A.s)/COUNT(A.user_id),2),0.00) AS average_sessions_per_user
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT user_id, COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) AS s
      FROM Activity
      WHERE activity_date >= '2019-06-28' AND activity_date <= '2019-07-27'
      GROUP BY user_id) AS A;
```
**Wrong** 
* subquery comes more than one row, so can do run the calculation

```sql
SELECT IFNULL(ROUND((SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT session_id)
              FROM Activity
              WHERE activity_date >= '2019-06-28' AND activity_date <= '2019-07-27'
              GROUP BY user_id) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)
                                    FROM Activity
                                    WHERE activity_date >= '2019-06-28' AND activity_date <= '2019-07-27'),2),0.00) AS  average_sessions_per_user
FROM Activity;
```
## Notes
* division comes with IFNULL to avoid denominator being 0

*  **COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) AS s** should be specified a name for count column in subquery
