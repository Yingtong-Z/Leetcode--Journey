# 1303. Find the Team Size

## Description

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-team-size/)


## Solution

**Using window function**

```SQL
SELECT employee_id, COUNT(*) OVER(PARTITION BY team_id) AS team_size
FROM Employee;
```
```COUNT(*)``` () can be (team_id),(employee_id), (1) any number, since group by team_id, can only count one column left

**Traditional group by**
```SQL
SELECT E1.employee_id, E2.team_size
FROM Employee E1
LEFT JOIN (SELECT team_id, COUNT(*) AS team_size
           FROM Employee
           GROUP BY team_id) E2           
ON E1.team_id = E2.team_id
```
## Notes
**Window Functions**

_Window Function Refresher https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-cookbook-2nd/9781492077435/app01.html_

* Window functions are performed as the **last step** in SQL processing prior to the **ORDER BY** clause
* ```PARTITION BY``` clause as a “moving GROUP BY” because unlike a traditional ```GROUP BY```, a group created by ```PARTITION BY``` is not distinct in a result set. 
  * You can use PARTITION BY to compute an aggregation over a defined group of rows (resetting when a new group is encountered), and rather than having one group represent all instances of that value in the table, each value (each member in each group) is returned
* ```PARTITION BY``` clause performs its **computations independently** of other window functions, partitioning by different columns in the same SELECT statement
* ```Order by``` in ```over()``` basically is running total

* **order by in window functions**
* When you use an ORDER BY clause in the OVER clause of a window function, you are specifying two things:
  * How the rows in the partition are ordered
  * What rows are included in the computation

```
select deptno,
       ename,
       hiredate,
       sal,
       sum(sal)over(partition by deptno) as total1,
       sum(sal)over() as total2,
       sum(sal)over(order by hiredate) as running_total
  from emp
 where deptno=10

DEPTNO  ENAME   HIREDATE      SAL TOTAL1 TOTAL2 RUNNING_TOTAL
------  ------  ----------- ----- ------ ------ -------------
    10  CLARK   09-JUN-1981  2450   8750   8750          2450
    10  KING    17-NOV-1981  5000   8750   8750          7450

* PARTITION BY clause performs its **computations independently** of other window functions, partitioning by different columns in the same SELECT statement
```sql
SELECT start_terminal,
       duration_seconds,
       SUM(duration_seconds) OVER
         (PARTITION BY start_terminal) AS running_total,
       COUNT(duration_seconds) OVER
         (PARTITION BY start_terminal) AS running_count,
       AVG(duration_seconds) OVER
         (PARTITION BY start_terminal) AS running_avg
  FROM tutorial.dc_bikeshare_q1_2012
