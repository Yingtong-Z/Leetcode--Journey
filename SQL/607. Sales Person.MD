# 607. Sales Person

## Description

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/sales-person/)


## Solution

```SQL
SELECT name
FROM Salesperson S
WHERE S.sales_id NOT IN (
    SELECT O.sales_id 
    FROM Orders O 
    LEFT JOIN Company C
    ON O.com_id=C.com_id
    WHERE C.name = 'RED')
```

## Notes

* The wrong answer
* red can be com_id=1 or com_id=10... , so it need to join the company table to specify the company red

```SQL
SELECT name
FROM Salesperson S
WHERE S.sales_id NOT IN (
    SELECT O.sales_id 
    FROM Orders O 
    WHERE O.com_id = 1)
```
