## Description

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-travellers/)


## Solution

```SQL
SELECT U.name, IFNULL(SUM(R.distance),0) AS travelled_distance
FROM Users U
LEFT JOIN Rides R
ON U.id = R.user_id
GROUP BY R.user_id
ORDER BY travelled_distance DESC, U.name ASC;
```
* ```ORDER BY travelled_distance``` not ```ORDER BY R.distance```
*  don't group by on name since 2 users can have same name.
