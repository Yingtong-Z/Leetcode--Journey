# 1076. Project Employees II

## Description

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/project-employees-ii/)


## Solution

* Logic: select the max count employee_id from a subquery

```SQL
SELECT project_id
FROM Project
GROUP BY project_id
HAVING COUNT(employee_id) = 
        (SELECT MAX(ct) 
         FROM (SELECT project_id, COUNT(employee_id) AS ct
               FROM Project 
               GROUP BY project_id) AS P);
```


## Notes
* MAX(), COUNT(), must connect () right away

* Could avoid distinct in the inner query **(SELECT project_id, COUNT(employee_id) AS ct)**
  *  because **project_id** and **employee_id** are primary key in the project table.
