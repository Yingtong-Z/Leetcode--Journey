[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/students-and-examinations/)


## Solution

### Solution 1

```SQL
SELECT S.student_id, S.student_name, B.subject_name, IFNULL(E.attended_exams,0) AS attended_exams
FROM Students S
JOIN Subjects B
LEFT JOIN (SELECT student_id, subject_name,COUNT(*) AS attended_exams
           FROM Examinations
           GROUP BY student_id, subject_name) E
ON S.student_id = E.student_id AND B.subject_name = E.subject_name
ORDER BY S.student_id, B.subject_name;
```
* left join is a subquery for direct understanding

### Solution 2

```sql
SELECT student.student_id,student.student_name,subject.subject_name,COUNT(exam.subject_name) as attended_exams
FROM Students as student
JOIN Subjects as subject
LEFT JOIN Examinations as exam
ON student.student_id=exam.student_id AND subject.subject_name=exam.subject_name
GROUP BY student.student_id,subject.subject_name
ORDER BY student_id,subject_name;
```
* left join with a neater solution rather than subquery

## Notes
* ```GROUP BY student.student_id,subject.subject_name``` group by studen_id, subject_name will have the foloowed output

```
+------------+--------------+--------------+----------------+
| student_id | student_name | subject_name | attended_exams |
+------------+--------------+--------------+----------------+
| 1          | Alice        | Math         | 3              |
| 1          | Alice        | Physics      | 2              |
| 1          | Alice        | Programming  | 1              |

```
* Here the ```JOIN``` is cross join
  *   if no WHERE clause is used - join is **cross join**
  *   If WHERE clause is used -> it functions like an **INNER JOIN.**
