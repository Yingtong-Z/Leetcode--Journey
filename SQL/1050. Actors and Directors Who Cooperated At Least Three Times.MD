# 1050. Actors and Directors Who Cooperated At Least Three Times

## Description

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/actors-and-directors-who-cooperated-at-least-three-times/)


## Solution

**Correct**

```SQL
SELECT actor_id, director_id
FROM ActorDirector
GROUP BY actor_id, director_id
HAVING COUNT(timestamp/*) >= 3;
```
**Wrong and deplicate** 

```sql
SELECT actor_id, director_id
FROM ActorDirector
WHERE (actor_id, director_id) IN (SELECT actor_id, director_id
                                  FROM ActorDirector
                                  GROUP BY actor_id, director_id
                                  HAVING COUNT(timestamp) >= 3;
```
## Notes
* SELECT... GROUP BY... HAVING COUNT , always start from simple command logic

* HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3 is better than HAVING COUNT(timestamp) >= 3
