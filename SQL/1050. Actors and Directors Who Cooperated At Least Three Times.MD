GROUP BY actor_id, director_id
HAVING COUNT(timestamp/*) >= 3;
```

```sql
SELECT actor_id, director_id
FROM ActorDirector
WHERE (actor_id, director_id) IN (SELECT actor_id, director_id
                                  FROM ActorDirector
                                  GROUP BY actor_id, director_id
                                  HAVING COUNT(timestamp) >= 3;
```
## Notes
SELECT... GROUP BY... HAVING COUNT , always start from simple command logic
