## Notes

### IFNULL
  * IFNULL(expression, alt_value)
  * The IFNULL() function returns a specified value if the expression is NULL.
	* If the expression is NOT NULL, this function returns the expression.

  * **expression should have (); IFNULL should specified as output colum name AS X**
  ```SQL
  SELECT IFNULL(
  (SELECT...)
  , null) AS X
  ```
  * EG.
```SQL
SELECT IFNULL(NULL,500)
```
Result: 500

```SQL
SELECT IFNULL('hello','abc')
```
Result: hello

### ROUND
  * ROUND(number, decimals, operation)
  * EG.
```SQL
SELECT ROUND(235.415, 2) AS RoundValue
```
Result: RoundValue: 235.41

```SQL
SELECT ROUND(235.415, -1) AS RoundValue;
```

Result: RoundValue: 240
