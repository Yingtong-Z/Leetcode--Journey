## Description

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-selling-price/)


## Solution


```SQL
SELECT U.product_id, ROUND(SUM(U.units*P.price)/SUM(U.units),2) AS average_price
FROM UnitsSold U
LEFT JOIN Prices P
ON U.product_id = P.product_id AND U.purchase_date Between P.start_date AND P.end_date
GROUP BY U.product_id;
```

## Notes
* when using groupby, must specify the aggregate function ```SUM(U.units*P.price)```, otherwise, it doesn't know to sum up all the unit*price

* ```ON U.product_id = P.product_id AND U.purchase_date Between P.start_date AND P.end_date``` ON the same key with condition
