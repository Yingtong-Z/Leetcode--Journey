# 1241. Number of Comments per Post

## Description

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-comments-per-post/)


## Solution

### Solution 1

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT S1.sub_id AS post_id, IFNULL((SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sub_id)
 FROM Submissions S2
 WHERE S2.parent_id = S1.sub_id),0 
 GROUP BY S2.parent_id)  AS number_of_comments 
FROM Submissions S1
WHERE parent_id IS NULL
ORDER BY S1.sub_id
```
* This is slow because it iterate every row

### Solution 2

```sql
SELECT S1.sub_id AS post_id, IFNULL(COUNT(DISTINCT S2.sub_id),0) AS number_of_comments 
FROM Submissions S1
LEFT JOIN Submissions S2
ON S1.sub_id = S2.parent_id
WHERE S1.parent_id IS NULL
GROUP BY S1.sub_id
ORDER BY S1.sub_id;
```
* LEFT JOIN simplified ,but only faster than 20%
### Solution 3

```sql
SELECT S1.sub_id AS post_id, IFNULL(COUNT(DISTINCT S2.sub_id),0) AS number_of_comments 
FROM (SELECT sub_id
      FROM Submissions
      WHERE parent_id IS NULL) AS S1
LEFT JOIN (SELECT sub_id, parent_id
           FROM Submissions
           WHERE parent_id IS NOT NULL) AS S2
ON S1.sub_id = S2.parent_id
GROUP BY S1.sub_id
ORDER BY S1.sub_id;
```
* left join fadter than 50%

## Notes
* very complicated layer with layer selection
