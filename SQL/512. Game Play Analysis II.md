# 512. Game Play Analysis II


## Description

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/game-play-analysis-ii/)


## Solution

**Correct**
```SQL
SELECT player_id, device_id
FROM Activity
WHERE (player_id, event_date) IN (
SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date)
FROM Activity 
GROUP BY player_id)
```

**Wrong**
```SQL
SELECT P.player_id, P.device_id
FROM (SELECT player_id, **device_id**, min(event_date) 
	    FROM Activity
	    GROUP BY player_id) AS P
```
* A player can log in to different devices so when group by **player_id** he knows how to get **min(event_date)**, but not which **device_id** to query
