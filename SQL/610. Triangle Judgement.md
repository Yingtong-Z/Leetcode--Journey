## Description

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/triangle-judgement/)


## Solution

### Solution 1
```SQL
SELECT *,
    if (x+y > z AND x+z>y AND y+z>x, 'Yes', 'No') AS 'triangle'
FROM triangle;
```

### Solution 2
```SQL
SELECT *, (case when x+y > z AND 
                     x+z > y AND
                     z+y > x THEN 'Yes' 
                else 'No' end) AS 'triangle'
FROM triangle;
```

## Notes

**Functions assign new values based on the conditions**

* IF(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false)

```SQL
SELECT OrderID, Quantity, IF(Quantity>10, "MORE", "LESS")
FROM OrderDetails;
```
* CASE WHEN 
  - The CASE statement goes through conditions and return a value when the first condition is met (like an IF-THEN-ELSE statement). 
  - So, once a condition is true, it will stop reading and return the result.
  - If no conditions are true, it will return the value in the ELSE clause.
  - If there is no ELSE part and no conditions are true, it returns NULL.

```SQL
SELECT OrderID, Quantity,
	CASE
	    WHEN Quantity > 30 THEN "The quantity is greater than 30"
	    WHEN Quantity = 30 THEN "The quantity is 30"
	    ELSE "The quantity is under 30"
	END
FROM OrderDetails;
```
