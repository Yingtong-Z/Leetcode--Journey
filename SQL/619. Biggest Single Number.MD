[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/biggest-single-number/)


## Solution

### Solution 1
```SQL
SELECT IFNULL(
        (SELECT num 
         FROM MyNumbers
         GROUP BY num
         HAVING count(num) = 1
         ORDER BY num DESC
         LIMIT 1)
        , null) AS num;
```

### Solution 2
```SQL
SELECT
    MAX(num) AS num
FROM
    (SELECT num
    FROM my_numbers
    GROUP BY num
    HAVING COUNT(num) = 1) AS t;
```

## Notes

### IFNULL
  * IFNULL(expression, alt_value)
  * The IFNULL() function returns a specified value if the expression is NULL.
	* If the expression is NOT NULL, this function returns the expression.

  * **expression should have (); IFNULL should specified as output colum name AS X**
  ```SQL
  SELECT IFNULL(
  (SELECT...)
  , null) AS X
  ```
  * EG.
```SQL
SELECT IFNULL(NULL,500)
```
Result: 500

```SQL
SELECT IFNULL('hello','abc')
```
Result: hello

### MAX
  * The max() will take care of the null condition. no need for IFNULL and LIMIT 1

  * select max(null) will result in null
