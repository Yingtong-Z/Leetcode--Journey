 # 1435. Create a Session Bar Chart

## Description

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/create-a-session-bar-chart/)


## Solution

### Solution 1

```SQL
select "[0-5>" as bin, count(session_id) as total from Sessions where duration/60>=0 and duration/60<5
union
select "[5-10>" as bin, count(session_id) as total from Sessions where duration/60>=5 and duration/60<10
union
select "[10-15>" as bin, count(session_id) as total from Sessions where duration/60>=10 and duration/60<15
union
select "15 or more" as bin, count(session_id) as total from Sessions where duration/60>=15
```
* slow and inefficient
 
### Solution 1

```sql
SELECT '[0-5>' AS 'bin', SUM(duration/60 < 5) AS 'total'
FROM Sessions
UNION
SELECT '[5-10>' AS 'bin', SUM(duration/60 >= 5 AND duration/60 < 10) AS 'total'
FROM Sessions
UNION
SELECT '[10-15>' AS 'bin', SUM(duration/60 >= 10 AND duration/60 < 15) AS 'total'
FROM Sessions
UNION
SELECT '15 or more' AS 'bin', SUM(duration/60 >= 15) AS 'total'
FROM Sessions
```
* ```(duration/60 >= 5)``` would return many rows. 
* All rows where that function holds TRUE would be 1, and all rows where that function is FALSE would be 0. 
* SUM() will aggregate all of those 1s and 0s into one number, which would be the sum of all the TRUE values, so essentially a count of all the rows that are true when tested against the condition you put in.



## Notes
* ```sum(duration/60 < 5)``` is just like count, sum is better than count when filter condition to do count
