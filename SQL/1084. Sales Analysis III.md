**My Solution**

```SQL
SELECT P.product_id, product_name
FROM Product P
WHERE P.product_id NOT IN (SELECT product_id 
                           FROM Sales
                           WHERE sale_date 
                           NOT BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-03-31');

SELECT product_id, product_name 
FROM Product 
WHERE product_id IN
(SELECT product_id
FROM Sales
GROUP BY product_id
HAVING MIN(sale_date) >= '2019-01-01' AND MAX(sale_date) <= '2019-03-31')
