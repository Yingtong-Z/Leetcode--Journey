[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/immediate-food-delivery-i/)


## Solution

### Solution 1

```SQL
	SELECT 
	IFNULL(ROUND((SELECT COUNT(order_date) 
	              FROM Delivery
	              WHERE order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) /
	             (SELECT COUNT(order_date) 
	              FROM Delivery)*100,2),0.00) 
	AS immediate_percentage;
```
* ifnull is not necessary when the denminoator is obviously not 0

### Solution 2

```sql
select round(100 * sum(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) / count(*), 2) as immediate_percentage 
from Delivery;
```

### Solution 3

```sql
select round(100 * avg(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date), 2) as immediate_percentage 
from Delivery;
```


## Notes
* AVG(), SUM() can take care of boolean since they ignore the null value 
* ``` SELECT SUM(IF(my_bool=1, 1, 0)) AS YES, SUM(IF(my_bool=0, 1, 0)) AS NO ```
  *   only sum the 1 'true' value in the boolean
  *   SUM(IF(my_bool=1, 1, 0)) = SUM(my_bool=1)
* ``` avg(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) ```
  * true/true+false
