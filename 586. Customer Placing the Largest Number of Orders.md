----

## Solution

```SQL
SELECT customer_number
FROM Orders
GROUP BY customer_number
ORDER BY count(*)  DESC
LIMIT 1;
SELECT
ROUND(
	   IFNULL(
	   (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT requester_id, accepter_id FROM RequestAccepted) AS A)
	   /
	   (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT sender_id, send_to_id FROM FriendRequest) AS B),
	   0)
, 2) AS accept_rate;
```

## Notes

### IFNULL
  * IFNULL(expression, alt_value)
  * EG.
```SQL
SELECT ROUND(235.415, 2) AS RoundValue
```
  * The IFNULL() function returns a specified value if the expression is NULL.
	* If the expression is NOT NULL, this function returns the expression.

### ROUND
  * ROUND(number, decimals, operation)
  * EG.
```SQL
SELECT ROUND(235.415, 2) AS RoundValue
```
SELECT ROUND(235.415, -1) AS RoundValue;
